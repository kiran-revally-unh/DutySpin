🧹 DutySpin

🔗 Live App: https://dutyspin.web.app/

DutySpin is a minimal utility app for managing shared chores using a simple turn-based responsibility model.

It answers just one question:

Who’s responsible right now?

The app is intentionally focused on fairness and clarity—not productivity hacks, notifications, or gamification.
